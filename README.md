# Spark
In this repository, I share some projects I have done in my Spark course at IE HST. These projects were done using PySpark.

# 1. E-commerce, a look behind the hidden curtain with PySpark

The goal of this analysis is to get a general overview on some operation and performance metrics of a fully online retailer based in one country. The interesting part of this project is the size of the dataset (541,909 rows and 8 columns), which is the motivation to test a tool to analyse Big Data. I here use PySpark, the Python API written to support Apache Spark. 

Findind data about an ecommerce is not an easy task. Luckily, the UCI Machine Learning Repository has made publicly available a dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011 for an Online Retail business based in the United Kingdom. The main products sold by the company are unique all-occasion giftware. Also, many customers of this e-commerce are wholesalers. This dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II.

I here share the PySpark code and a report summarizing the main take aways of the analysis.
